        "feedback": "The response accurately identifies the type of clothing specified for the dummy as form-fitting cotton stretch garments. However, it includes additional information not present in the reference answer, specifically mentioning short sleeves in paragraph 7.3. Additionally, the response states that mid-calf length trousers are specified, whereas the reference answer only mentions mid-calf length pant, which implies a single garment rather than specifying both pants and trousers.",
