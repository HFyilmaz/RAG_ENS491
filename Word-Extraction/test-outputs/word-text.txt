		0.		Scope
This Regulation applies to direction indicators for vehicles of categories L, M, N, O, and T.
		1.		Definitions
For the purposes of this Regulation,
1.1.	"Direction indicator" means a device mounted on a motor vehicle or trailer which, when operated by the driver, signals the latter's intention to change the direction in which the vehicle is proceeding. The present Regulation applies solely to fixed-position flashing light devices whose flashing is obtained by the intermittent supply of electric current to the lamp.
1.2.	The definitions given in UN Regulation No. 48 and its series of amendments in force at the time of application for type approval shall apply to this Regulation.
1.3.	"Direction indicators of different types" means lamps which differ in such essential respects as:
(a)	The trade name or mark:
(i)	Lamps bearing the same trade name or mark but produced by different manufacturers shall be considered as being of different types;
(ii)	Lamps produced by the same manufacturer differing only by the trade name or mark shall be considered as being of the same type. 
(b)	The characteristics of the optical system (levels of intensity, light distribution angles, category of light source, light source module, etc.);
(c)	The category of direction indicator lamps;
(d)	The variable intensity control, if any;
(e)	The sequential activation of light sources, if any.
Nevertheless, direction indicators capable of being activated in different modes (sequential or not) without any modification of the optical characteristics of the lamp do not constitute "Direction indicators of different types".
A change of the colour of the light source or the colour of any filter does not constitute a change of type.
1.4.	References made in this Regulation to standard (étalon) filament lamp(s) and to UN Regulation No. 37 shall refer to UN Regulation No. 37 and its series of amendments in force at the time of application for type approval.
	References made in this Regulation to standard (étalon) LED light source(s) and to UN Regulation No. 128 shall refer to UN Regulation No. 128 and its series of amendments in force at the time of application for type approval.
		2.		Application for approval
2.1.		The application for approval of a type of direction indicator shall be submitted by the holder of the trade name or mark or by his duly accredited representative. It shall specify to which category or to which of the categories 1, 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 5 or 6 according to Annex 1, the direction indicator belongs and, if it belongs to category 2, whether it has steady luminous intensity (category 2a) or whether it has variable luminous intensity (category 2b) and if the direction indicator may also be used in an assembly of two lamps of the same category. At the choice of the applicant, it will also	specify that the device may be installed on the vehicle with different inclinations of the reference axis in respect to the vehicle reference planes and to the ground or rotate around its reference axis; these different conditions of installation shall be indicated in the communication form.
2.2.	For each type of direction indicator the application shall be accompanied by the following:
2.2.1.	Drawings, in triplicate, sufficiently detailed to permit identification of the type and category and showing geometrically the following:

		5.		General specifications
The requirements contained in sections 5. "General specifications" and 6. "Individual specifications" and in the Annexes referenced in the said sections of UN Regulations Nos. 48, 53, 74 or 86, and their series of amendments in force at the time of application for the lamp type approval shall apply to this Regulation.
	The requirements pertinent to each lamp and to the category/ies of vehicle on which the lamp is intended to be installed shall be applied, where its verification at the moment of lamp type approval is feasible.
5.1.	Each device supplied shall conform to the specifications set forth in paragraphs 6. and 8. below.
5.2.	The devices shall be so designed and constructed that under normal conditions of use and notwithstanding the vibrations to which they may be subjected in such use, their satisfactory operation remains assured and they retain the characteristics prescribed by this Regulation.
5.3.		In the case of light source modules, it shall be checked that:
5.3.1.		The design of the light source module(s) shall be such as:
(a)	That each light source module can only be fitted in no other position than the designated and correct one and can only be removed with the use of tool(s); 
(b)	If there are more than one light source module used in the housing for a device, light source modules having different characteristics can not be interchanged within the same lamp housing.
5.3.2.	The light source module(s) shall be tamperproof.
5.3.3.	A light source module shall be so designed that regardless of the use of tool(s), it shall not be mechanically interchangeable with any replaceable approved light source.
5.4.	In case of failure of the variable intensity control of a direction indicator of category 2b emitting more than the maximum value of category 2a, requirements of steady luminous intensity of category 2a shall be fulfilled automatically.
5.5.		In the case of replaceable light source(s):
5.5.1.	The device shall only be equipped with light source(s) approved according to UN Regulation No. 37 and/or UN Regulation No. 128, provided that no restriction on the use is made in UN Regulation No. 37 and its series of amendments in force at the time of application for type approval or in UN Regulation No. 128 and its series of amendments in force at the time of application for type approval.
5.5.2.	The design of the device shall be such that light source cannot be fixed in any other position but the correct one.
5.5.3.	The light source holder shall conform to the characteristics given in IEC Publication 60061. The holder data sheet relevant to the category of light source used, applies.
5.6.	In the case of non-replaceable filament lamp(s) or light source module(s) equipped with non-replaceable filament lamp(s), the applicant shall annex to the type approval documentation a report (by the light source manufacturer indicated in the type approval documentation), acceptable to the Type Approval Authority, that demonstrates compliance of these non-replaceable filament lamp(s) with the requirements as specified in paragraph 4.11. of IEC 60809, Edition 3.
5.7.	For direction indicator lamps of categories 1, 1a, 1b, 2a or 2b the flash may be produced by sequential activation of their light sources if the following conditions are met:
(a)	Each light source, after its activation, shall remain lit until the end of the ON cycle;
(b)	The sequence of activation of the light sources shall produce a signal which proceeds in a uniform progressive manner from inboard towards the outboard edge of the light emitting surface;
(c)	It shall be one signal with no interruption and no vertical oscillations (e.g. not more than one change of direction along the vertical axis). The distance between two adjacent/tangential distinct parts of the light emitting surface of the sequential direction indicator shall not exceed 50mm, when measured perpendicularly to the reference axis, instead of the values defined in paragraph 5.7.2. of UN Regulation 48. These interruptions of the signal shall not create any overlap in the vertical axis between the different parts, from inboard towards the outboard of the vehicle, and shall not be used for any other lighting or light signalling functions;
(d)	The variation shall finish no more than 200ms after the beginning of the ON cycle;
(e)	The orthogonal projection of the light emitting surfaces of the direction indicator in the direction of the axis of reference shall be circumscribed by a rectangle on a plane normal to the axis of reference and having its longer sides parallel to the H-plane. The ratio of the horizontal to the vertical sides shall not be less than 1.7.
Compliance to the conditions mentioned above shall be verified in flashing mode.
5.8.	An interdependent lamp system shall meet the requirements when all its interdependent lamps are operated together.
However, if the interdependent lamp system providing the rear direction indicator function is partly mounted on the fixed component and partly mounted on a movable component, the interdependent lamp(s) specified by the Applicant shall meet the geometric visibility, colorimetric and photometric requirement, at all fixed positions of the movable component(s). This does not apply to interdependent direction indicator lamp(s) intended for fitting on vehicle(s) where, to fulfil or complete the geometric visibility angle, additional lamps are activated when the movable component is in any fixed open position, provided that these additional lamps satisfy all the position, photometric and colorimetric requirements applicable to the direction indicator lamps installed on the movable component.
		6.		Intensity of light emitted
6.1.	The light emitted by each of the two lamps supplied must be in the case of direction indicators of categories 1, 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, in the reference axes, in the case of direction indicators of categories 5 or 6 in direction A according to Annex 1 of not less than the minimum intensity and of not more than the maximum intensity specified below:
6.1.1.	For an assembly of two or more direction indicator lamps the total intensity shall not exceed the maximum value.
6.1.2.	When an assembly of two lamps marked "D" having the same function is deemed to be a single lamp, it shall comply with the requirements for:
(a)	Maximum intensity if all lamps together are lit;
	(b)	Minimum intensity if one lamp has failed.
6.2.	In case of failure of a single lamp, or of an interdependent lamp system of the categories 1, 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b, containing more than one light source the following provisions shall apply:
6.2.1.	A group of light sources, wired so that the failure of any one of them causes all of them to stop emitting light, shall be considered to be one light source.
6.2.2.	A signal for activation of the tell-tale prescribed in paragraph 6.5.8. of UN Regulation No. 48 shall be produced if:
(a)	Any one light source has failed, or
(b)	In the case of a lamp designed for only two light sources, the intensity in the axis of reference is less than 50 per cent of the minimum intensity, or
	(c)	As a consequence of a failure of one or more light sources, the 	intensity in one of the following directions as indicated in Annex 4 to 	this Regulation is less than the minimum intensity required:
	(i)	H=0°, V=0°
	(ii)	H=20° to the outside of the vehicle, V= +5°
	(iii)	H=10° to the inside of the vehicle, V= 0°.
6.3.	Outside the reference axis, within the angular fields specified in the arrangement diagrams in Annex 1 to this Regulation, the intensity of the light emitted by each of the two devices supplied shall:
6.3.1.	In each direction corresponding to the points in the relevant table of luminous-intensity distribution reproduced in Annex 4 to this Regulation, be not less than the minimum specified in paragraph 6.1. above multiplied by the percentage specified in the said table for the direction in question;
6.3.1.1.	In divergence from paragraphs 6.3. and 6.3.1. above, for categories 5 direction indicators, to the rear, a minimum value of 0.6 cd is required throughout the fields specified in Annex 1;
6.3.2.	In no direction within the area from which the indicator lamp is visible, exceed the maximum specified in paragraph 6.1. above;
6.3.3.	Moreover,
6.3.3.1.	Throughout the fields defined in the diagrams in Annex 1, the intensity of the light emitted shall be not less than 0.7 cd for devices of category 1b, not less than 0.3 cd for devices of categories 1, 1a, 2a and for those of category 2b by day; it shall not be less than 0.07 cd for devices of category 2b by night;
6.3.3.2.	The provisions of paragraph 2.2. of Annex 4 to this Regulation on local variations of intensity shall be observed.
6.4.	In general the intensities shall be measured with the light source(s) continuously alight.
	However, depending on the construction of the device, for example, the use of light-emitting diodes (LED), or the need to take precautions to avoid overheating, it is allowed to measure the lamps in flashing mode.
	This shall be achieved by switching with a frequency of f = 1.5 ± 0.5 Hz with the pulse width greater than 0.3 s, measured at 95 per cent peak light intensity.
	In the case of replaceable filament lamps, the filament lamps shall be operated at reference luminous flux during on time. 
In the case of LED light sources all measurements shall be made at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V; the luminous flux value produced during on time shall be corrected. The correction factor is the ratio between the objective luminous flux and the value of the luminous flux during on time found at the voltage applied.
In all other cases the voltage as required in paragraph 7.1.1. below shall be switched with a rise time and fall time shorter than 0.01 s; no overshoot is allowed.
	In the case of measurements taken in flashing mode the reported luminous intensity shall be represented by the maximum intensity.
6.5.	In the case of devices of category 2b the time that elapses between energizing the light source(s) and the light output measured on the reference axis to reach 90 per cent of the value measured in accordance with paragraph 6.3. above shall be measured for the extreme levels of luminous intensity produced by the direction indicator. The time measured to obtain the lowest luminous intensity shall not exceed the time measured to obtain the highest luminous intensity.
6.6.	The variable intensity control shall not generate signals which cause luminous intensities:
6.6.1.	Outside the range specified in paragraph 6.1. above and
6.6.2.	Exceeding the category 2a maximum specified in paragraph 6.1. above:
(a)	For systems depending only on daytime and night time conditions: under night time conditions;
(b)	For other systems: under reference conditions as demonstrated 		by the manufacturer. 
6.7.	Annex 4, referred to in paragraph 6.3.1. above, gives particulars of the measurement methods to be used.
		7.		Test procedure
7.1.	All measurements, photometric and colorimetric, shall be made:
7.1.1.	In the case of a lamp with replaceable light source, if not supplied by an electronic light source control gear or a variable intensity control, with an uncoloured or coloured standard light source of the category prescribed for the device; supplied with the voltage:
(a) 	In the case of filament lamp(s), it is necessary to produce the reference luminous flux required for that category of filament lamp;
(b) 	In the case of LED light source(s) of 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V; the luminous flux value produced shall be corrected. The correction factor is the ratio between the objective luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied.
7.1.2.	In the case of a lamp equipped with non-replaceable light sources (filament lamps and other), at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V respectively.
7.1.3.	In the case of a system that uses an electronic light source control gear or a variable intensity control, being part of the lamp applying at the input terminals of the lamp the voltage declared by the manufacturer or, if not indicated, 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V respectively.

	Annex 4
		Photometric measurements
1.	Measurement methods
1.1.	During photometric measurements, stray reflections shall be avoided by appropriate masking.
1.2.	In case the results of measurements should be challenged, measurements shall be carried out in such a way as to meet the following requirements:
1.2.1.	The distance of measurement shall be such that the law of the inverse of the square of the distance is applicable;
1.2.2.	The measuring equipment shall be such that the angular aperture of the receiver viewed from the reference centre of the light is comprised between 10' and 1 degree;
1.2.3.	The intensity requirement for a particular direction of observation shall be deemed to be satisfied if that requirement is met in a direction deviating by not more than one-quarter of a degree from the direction of observation.
1.3.	In the case where the device may be installed on the vehicle in more than one or in a field of different positions the photometric measurements shall be repeated for each position or for the extreme positions of the field of the reference axis specified by the manufacturer.
2.	Table of standard light distribution in space for direction indicator lamps of categories 1, 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b.



For direction indicators of category 6


(outer side of the vehicle)
2.1.	The direction H = 0° and V = 0° corresponds to the reference axis. (On the vehicle, it is horizontal, parallel to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle and oriented in the required direction of visibility.) It passes through the centre of reference. The values shown in the tables give, for the various directions of measurement, the minimum intensities as a percentage of the minimum intensities required in the table in paragraph 6.1. of this Regulation:
2.1.1.	In the direction H = 0° and V = 0° for categories 1, 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b and in the case of category 5 in the angular area in the direction A as prescribed in Annex 1;
2.1.2.	In the direction H = 5° and V = 0° for category 6.
2.1.3.	However, in the case where a device is intended to be installed with its H plane at a mounting height less than 750 mm above the ground, the photometric intensity is verified only up to an angle of 5° downwards.
2.2.	Within the field of light distribution of paragraph 2. above, schematically shown as a grid, the light pattern should be substantially uniform, i.e. in so far as the light intensity in each direction of a part of the field formed by the grid lines shall meet at least the lowest minimum value being shown on the grid lines surrounding the questioned direction as a percentage.
3.	Photometric measurement of lamps
	The photometric performance shall be checked:
3.1.	For non-replaceable light sources (filament lamps and other):
	With the light sources present in the lamp, in accordance with the relevant sub-paragraph of paragraph 7.1. of this Regulation.
3.2.	For replaceable light source(s):
When equipped with light source(s) at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V, the luminous intensity values produced shall be corrected. For filament lamps the correction factor is the ratio between the reference luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied (6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V).  
For LED light sources the correction factor is the ratio between the objective luminous flux and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage applied (6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V). 
	The actual luminous fluxes of light source used shall not deviate more than 5 per cent from the mean value. Alternatively and in case of filament lamps only, a standard filament lamp may be used in turn, in each of the individual positions, operated at its reference flux, the individual measurements in each position being added together.
3.3.	For any direction indicator lamp except those equipped with filament lamp(s), the luminous intensities measured after one minute and after 30 minutes of operation in flashing mode (f = 1.5 Hz, duty factor 50 per cent), shall comply with the minimum and maximum requirements. The luminous intensity distribution after one minute of operation can be calculated by applying at each test point the ratio of luminous intensity measured in HV after one minute and after 30 minutes of operation as above described.
